# Network Engineering Pro

**Network Engineering Pro (NetEng-Pro)** is a dedicated community focused on
providing **guides, reference materials, and resources** for **Free/Libre and
Open Source Software (FLOSS)**, with a primary emphasis on **Android** and
select **Linux projects**.

We advocate for **truly free software**—a distinction that goes beyond cost. To
understand the deeper meaning of “free” in this context, check out:

- [The FSF/GNU definition of free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
- [A less technical explanation](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/#free-in-free-and-open-source-software-does-not-mean-free-of-cost)

As a proud **member of the
[Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://www.fsf.org/)**, our mission is to
promote and advance software freedom, aligning with the
[FSF/GNU principles](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#fs-definition)
and the four freedoms. However, we critically evaluate all available solutions
to ensure the best approach for privacy, security, and user empowerment.

### Our Focus Areas:

🔹 **Privacy & Security** – Covering topics like **browser hardening,
privacy-focused DNS services, and secure communications**  
🔹 **FLOSS Advocacy** – Encouraging ethical software choices and
community-driven development  
🔹 **Technical Discussions & Guides** – Providing in-depth resources to help
users navigate the world of open-source technology

🚀 Stay tuned for updates as we explore these crucial topics in depth!

## 💡 Collective Knowledge

**Recognizing the limitations of individual-driven privacy websites and outdated
lists, we are dedicated to offering a broad range of current and diverse views
on privacy-centric apps and projects.** We wholeheartedly encourage (and expect)
community input to enrich and maintain our collective knowledge base.

Individual-driven projects and lists inevitably become outdated quickly; it is
our belief that effective lists and privacy documentation **_MUST_** be
community-driven and maintained.
[NetEng-Pro Discussions](https://discuss.neteng.pro) on GitHub will serve as our
primary collaboration platform. Slack and a Stack Overflow Team are also
available to community members.

&nbsp;

_Our primary short-term objective is to curate an up-to-date list of recommended
FLOSS (and occasionally notable closed-source) apps for Android users._ This
list is intended as a starting point. Once complete, I anticipate that it will
evolve through collaborative efforts, with the community leading Discussions and
driving updates.

> _The starting point for this project is the
> [Best-FOSS-Apps-for-Android](https://github.com/NetEng-Pro/Best-FOSS-Apps-for-Android)
> repository. The repo was forked from a now-abandoned project. Some edits have
> been made, but it needs a rewrite (the original author used a lot of foreign
> characters) and community review / input._

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Network Security Enginneer specializing in
[Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com) solutions, including
PAN-OS [Next-Gen Firewalls](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os) (NGFWs)
and [Panorama management server](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/panorama).

With several years of experience in Android development, I have a strong passion
for integrating free and open source software (FLOSS) into my workflow. My
journey began with a desire to replace proprietary apps with open source
alternatives, and ever since, I’ve been exploring and curating the best FLOSS
apps available.

Additionally, I've been exploring various self-hosted solutions and plan to
provide _Best Practices_ documentation for beginners, among other content.
